        <h1>Hi I'm Chris...</h1>
        <p>And this is my homepage. My goal is to use this as my primany outlet to communicate publicly and connect with new people. Right now, I'm just testing
            things out. I'm not really sure where this will go, but at least it's progressing. <br> <br> 
            
            Right now, there are much more efficient ways to connect with me. However, if you're on this page, we probably don't know each other and its unlikely that you can get a hold of me. I'm happy to share my contact info, but only with people I am familiar with.
            
            <br><br>Don't hesitate to reach out. If you want a reply, be sure to include a way you can be reached (ideally not via solo cups and strings) in the message box. I'm not particularly a fan of requiring people to send personally identifiable info, but I'm totally cool with connecting with people who choose to share contact info. I'll probably be able to get to the inital messages sent within a week or less. You can also reach out to me on social. I maintain accounts on several major platforms, but am only really active on snapchat for the time being.</p>
